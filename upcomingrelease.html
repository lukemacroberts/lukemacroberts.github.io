									<p>Luke Edit
All recording and mixing for Luke MacRoberts’ album was done in Madriguera Studio in the heart of Mexico City’s neighborhood La Merced. Iván Almanza, the studio’s founder and drummer for the band Apolo, engineered and produced all 13 tracks with Luke side by side. All mastering was done by the legendary Tom Baker (NIN, Modest Mouse, Cafe Tacvba, and Avenged Sevenfold among many others). 
Down The Hole may fall into the category of experimental or even post-prog, but the accessibility of the music to the every-day listener makes it stand out. Evident influences such as The Mars Volta and Nine Inch Nails, somehow sit comfortably alongside Graham Nash and Radiohead. The album is an ode to what everyone asks themselves at one point or another: Why? What’s the point? What is the next step? Why does any of this matter? It is meant to take us on a journey through one of the phases in our lives when the rut of our existence feels unescapable. Existentialism, comfort in the uncomfortable, and personal breaking-points are central themes throughout the record. The reality of an unclear path and an unattainable desire for something meaningful to occur is what lyrically links each song to the other. There are a whopping six instrumental tracks scattered throughout as well. The dark and dissonant harmonies and soundscape of the album’s style are what really makes this body of work shine. Through the combination of heavy effects, musicianship, unapologetic composition, and an overall melancholic tone, Down The Hole is an authentic look into the mind of Luke MacRoberts. 
The CD will be available on all digital platforms including Spotify, itunes, Bandcamp, Tidal, Googleplay, and Amazon by the beginning of May 2019.</p>

Down The Hole is a diverse and eclectic album. Never one to adhere to the path most traveled, MacRoberts’ album ranges from experimental to post-progressive genres, while nonetheless remaining accessible by the every-day listener. Evident influences such as The Mars Volta and Nine Inch Nails sit comfortably alongside the familiar themes of Graham Nash and Radiohead. 
The album explores the universal themes of existence and the difficulties of navigating the essential questions of life: why does any of this matter? It is meant to take the listener on a journey through a phase of life when the rut of existence feels unescapable. Existentialism, comfort in the uncomfortable, and personal breaking-points are central themes throughout the record. The reality of an unclear path and an unattainable desire for something meaningful to occur lyrically connects each song to the other. Six instrumental tracks scattered throughout the album provide reprieve for at the contemplative listener. The dark, dissonant harmonies and soundscape shine throughout the album and leave an impression as lasting as the sun. Through the combination of heavy effects, musicianship, and unapologetic composition, Down The Hole is an authentic look into the mind of Luke MacRoberts.

What makes Chicago-Raised, Mexican City Resident Luke MacRoberts standout as musician, composer, and singer-songwriter is that his debut album DOWN THE HOLE creates an opportunity for the unlikely fusion of genres like post-prog, alternative, and experimental music to become universally accessible. By incorporating modern effects and catchy melodies over less-expected progressions, and by exploring topics most that humans -- if not all humans -- find themselves ruminating on at whatever point their existentialist crisis may begin, the record manages draw-in a variety of critical listeners.
